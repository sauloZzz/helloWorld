# 👋 Hello World Interactive Program (Java)

This project is a simple **Java console application** that not only prints the traditional “Hello World” message but also interacts with the user by asking for their name, age, and gender.  
It’s a small step, but a meaningful one in learning how to handle **user input** and basic console output in Java ☕.
